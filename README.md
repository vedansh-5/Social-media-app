This project focuses on building a scalable and secure social media web application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). The application features user authentication, customizable profiles, post creation, and real-time chat functionality using Socket.IO. It allows for user engagement with tools like likes, comments, and shares, as well as a personalized content feed.

Key technologies include React for the frontend, Node.js and Express.js for the backend, MongoDB for data storage, and JWT for secure user authentication. The project addresses issues such as scalability, security, real-time interaction, and user engagement, with future scope including AI-driven personalization, multimedia integration, and enhanced real-time communication.

This application is designed to be deployed on platforms like Vercel, AWS, or Heroku, with CI/CD pipelines for efficient updates. It serves as a powerful tool for personal networking, content sharing, and community building.
